# Introduction to Next.js

Next.js is a powerful, open-source React framework developed by Vercel that enables developers to build fast, user-friendly web applications with ease. It extends React by providing a robust set of features for server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and client-side rendering—all within a single project.

## Key Features

- **File-based Routing**: Create pages by simply adding files to the `pages` or `app` directory. No complex configuration needed.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Render pages on the server for improved SEO and faster initial load times.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time for blazing-fast performance and easy deployment.
- **API Routes**: Build backend API endpoints directly within your Next.js app, eliminating the need for a separate server.
- **App Router (Next.js 13+)**: A modern, flexible routing system using React Server Components for better performance and developer experience.
- **Built-in Optimizations**: Automatic image optimization, font loading, script bundling, and code splitting out of the box.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Update static content after deployment without rebuilding the entire site.

## Why Choose Next.js?

Next.js strikes a perfect balance between performance, developer productivity, and scalability. It powers websites for companies like Netflix, Hulu, and Twitch, proving its reliability at scale. With first-class TypeScript support, middleware, and seamless integration with popular tools like Tailwind CSS and Prisma, it’s ideal for full-stack applications, e-commerce platforms, blogs, and marketing sites.

## Getting Started

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
